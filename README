Title: HW 1.06

Description:
This program is the 6th step in creating a rouge like game. This section was specifically 
to add more functions to the program. This included adding "fog" and teleportation. In 
order to use the fog functionality all you have to do is press the f button and then the 
screen will be covered in fog and you'll only be able to see the blocks around you. as you 
move around youll be able to also see the past locations as you remember them. To use the 
teleport function you will have to press the g button and then you can either move randomly 
with the button r or you can move the cursor. You move the cursor using the same buttons one 
would use for moving the pc however you can teleport outside of the walls. Then when the 
cursor is in the spot you wish to teleport then you press g again and that will place you in 
that position and if you land on another character the fighting sequence will occur. This 
section of the project was also used to switch from c to c++. 

 
 
Technologies used:
 We used CLion to write in C++. For the final test we used Ubuntu to see it on 
 the console. The two txt files were both done on Eclipse.
